# Note: This will be added in a later version

def print $a plus $b plus $c {
  print (a + b + c)
}

# The syntax will be either this:
fn = #"print $ plus $"
fn!["a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3] #=> 6
fn <- ["a": 2]
fn <- ["b": 5, "c": 3]
fn! #=> 10

# .. or this:
fn = func "print $ plus $"
apply $fn with (["a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3]) #=> 6
fn = apply $fn "a" 2
fn = apply $fn (["b": 5, "c": 3])
fn = apply $fn

# it will probably be the bottom one, since it looks nicer and is
# easier to implement
